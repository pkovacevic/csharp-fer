# CourseWork
Web application for managing students and courses.

#### 1 Setup solution
1.1 ASP.net Core with full .NET Framework.

1.1.1 New Project -> Installed -> Visual C# -> .NET Core - ASP.NET Core Web Application
**Make sure** `.NET Framework 4.7` is targeted.

1.1.2 
**Make sure** `.NET Framework` is selected in first list. 

1.1.3
Second drop down should be `ASP.NET Core 2.0` which is somewhat confusing.

1.1.4
Web Application (Model-View-Controller)

1.2 Remove production CSS and JS. It's confusing for now.

1.3 Remove contact and about pages. It makes to much noise.

1.4 Put two links that look like a button on home page.

1.5 Add links to navigation bar.

#### 2 Manage students

2.1 Add student controller and placeholder page. Make sure that controller and view are wired up nicely.
